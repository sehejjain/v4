- I worked under Dr. Kusum Kumari Bharti to solve the Genome Sequence Assembly problem by using Meta-Heuristics and Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithms.
- Through this project, we have proposed a new meta-heuristic and modifications to 2 existing algorithms.
- The relevant papers for these algorithms are under review in various journals.
