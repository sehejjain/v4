Through Sirhaana, we envision a service that will serve the urban poor, address their issue of handling emergencies and guide them through. We want to bridge the gap between the present-day healthcare systems and the urban poor, who mostly prefer their home remedies or are unaware of the schemes they are eligible for. We want to be a service that can have an impact and help people so that they are not turned away or taken advantage of because of their circumstances.
<b>"Trust our vision for us to return it back with our service."</b>
