Quester is our answer to the Hack 20 Flutter Hackathon. Quester sets you on a path of doing small and easy, yet heavily contributing missions for Saving the Planet. Each completed mission awards you with, drum roll, Experience Points! XP allows you to level up and brag about how you are taking steps for Saving the Planet!
